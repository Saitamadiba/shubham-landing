    <h1>The Complete Nakshatra Guide</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Discover Your Lunar Destiny Through Vedic Astrology</p>

    <div class="intro-box">
      <p><strong>Welcome, Cosmic Seeker!</strong></p>
      <p>In Vedic astrology, the Moon represents your mind, emotions, and inner self. While Western astrology focuses primarily on your Sun sign, Vedic wisdom teaches that your <strong>Moon sign</strong> and <strong>Nakshatra</strong> (lunar mansion) reveal the deeper truths about your personality, emotional patterns, and life path.</p>
      <p>This guide will help you understand your lunar placement and begin your journey into the profound wisdom of Jyotish (Vedic astrology).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calculator-box">
      <h3>Step 1: Calculate Your Sidereal Birth Chart</h3>
      <p>Before exploring the meanings below, you need to know your Moon sign and Nakshatra. Use this free calculator:</p>
      <p><a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/sidereal-astrology-chart-calculator" target="_blank">https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/sidereal-astrology-chart-calculator</a></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter your birth date, exact time, and location</li>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Select <strong>"Placidus"</strong> as your house system</li>
        <li>Make sure "Sidereal" zodiac is selected (this uses the true astronomical positions)</li>
        <li>Look for your <strong>Moon sign</strong> and <strong>Moon Nakshatra</strong> in the results</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Note: Your sidereal Moon sign may differ from your Western Moon sign by approximately one sign due to the precession of equinoxes.</em></p>

    <h2>Part I: Moon Through the Signs</h2>
    <p>Your Moon sign shows how you process emotions, what makes you feel secure, and your instinctive reactions to life.</p>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♈</span> Moon in Aries (Mesha)</h4>
      <p>You possess an emotionally courageous and pioneering spirit. Your feelings are direct, passionate, and often impulsive. You need independence and action to feel emotionally fulfilled. Boredom is your enemy—you thrive when pursuing new challenges. Your emotional responses are quick and fiery, though they may cool just as fast. You're naturally protective of those you love and aren't afraid to fight for what matters to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♉</span> Moon in Taurus (Vrishabha)</h4>
      <p>The Moon is exalted in Taurus, giving you exceptional emotional stability and sensory awareness. You find comfort in material security, nature, good food, and physical pleasures. Change unsettles you—you prefer steady, predictable environments. Your loyalty runs deep, and once you commit emotionally, you rarely waver. You have a gift for creating beauty and comfort wherever you go. Patience is your strength, though stubbornness can be your challenge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♊</span> Moon in Gemini (Mithuna)</h4>

    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♌</span> Moon in Leo (Simha)</h4>
      <p>You need to shine emotionally and crave recognition for who you truly are. Your heart is generous and warm—you love dramatically and expect loyalty in return. Creativity and self-expression are emotional necessities, not luxuries. You have natural dignity and take pride in your emotional responses. While you can be theatrical about your feelings, your warmth is genuine. Being ignored or feeling ordinary wounds you deeply.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♍</span> Moon in Virgo (Kanya)</h4>
      <p>You process emotions through analysis and seek to understand the "why" behind every feeling. Service to others brings you emotional satisfaction—you show love through practical help. You're sensitive to criticism and can be your own harshest judge. Order and routine comfort you; chaos creates anxiety. Your attention to detail extends to emotional matters, sometimes causing you to overthink feelings rather than simply experiencing them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♎</span> Moon in Libra (Tula)</h4>

Conflict disturbs you deeply—you're a natural peacemaker. Beauty in all forms soothes your soul. You may struggle with decisions, weighing options endlessly. Relationships define much of your emotional life; you feel most complete when sharing your world with a significant other.</p>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♏</span> Moon in Scorpio (Vrishchika)</h4>
      <p>Your emotions run deeper than most can fathom. You experience life with intense passion and aren't afraid of the darker aspects of human nature. Trust is earned slowly, but once given, your loyalty is absolute. You have powerful instincts and can detect dishonesty instantly. Transformation through emotional crisis is a recurring theme—you're skilled at dying and being reborn psychologically. Forgiveness doesn't come easily; betrayal is never forgotten.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♐</span> Moon in Sagittarius (Dhanu)</h4>
      <p>Freedom and meaning are your emotional oxygen. You need room to explore, both physically and philosophically. Optimism colors your emotional landscape—you believe things will work out, and they often do. You're honest about your feelings, sometimes to the point of bluntness. Routine and emotional heaviness suffocate you. You find emotional fulfillment through learning, travel, and connecting with something greater than yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♑</span> Moon in Capricorn (Makara)</h4>
      <p>Emotional maturity came to you early—you may have felt like an old soul even as a child. You process feelings with practicality and rarely let emotions override reason.

With time, you learn to balance ambition with emotional warmth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♒</span> Moon in Aquarius (Kumbha)</h4>
      <p>You experience emotions from a slightly detached, observational perspective. Your feelings connect to humanity as a whole—causes and ideals move you deeply. You need intellectual freedom and resist emotional possessiveness. Unconventional in your emotional expression, you may puzzle those expecting traditional responses. Friendship means more to you than passionate attachment. Your emotional well-being links to feeling part of something meaningful beyond yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sign-card">
      <h4><span class="sign-symbol">♓</span> Moon in Pisces (Meena)</h4>
      <p>You possess oceanic emotional sensitivity—boundaries between self and others blur easily. Compassion flows naturally from you; others' pain becomes your own. Creative and spiritual pursuits nourish your soul. You may escape into fantasy, art, or spirituality when reality becomes too harsh. Your intuition is extraordinary, bordering on psychic. Learning to protect your emotional boundaries while remaining open-hearted is your lifelong journey.</p>
    </div>
