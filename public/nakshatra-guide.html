      <h1>The Complete Nakshatra Guide</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Discover Your Lunar Destiny Through Vedic Astrology</p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro-box">
      <p><strong>Welcome, Cosmic Seeker!</strong></p>
      <p>In Vedic astrology, the Moon represents your mind, emotions, and inner self. While Western astrology focuses primarily on your Sun sign, Vedic wisdom teaches that your <strong>Moon sign</strong> and <strong>Nakshatra</strong> (lunar mansion) reveal the deeper truths about your personality, emotional patterns, and life path.</p>
      <p>This guide will help you understand your lunar placement and begin your journey into the profound wisdom of Jyotish (Vedic astrology).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="calculator-box">
      <h3>Step 1: Calculate Your Sidereal Birth Chart</h3>
      <p>Before exploring the meanings below, you need to know your Moon sign and Nakshatra. Use this free calculator:</p>
      <p><a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/sidereal-astrology-chart-calculator" target="_blank">https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/sidereal-astrology-chart-calculator</a></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter your birth date, exact time, and location</li>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Select <strong>"Placidus"</strong> as your house system</li>
        <li>Make sure "Sidereal" zodiac is selected (uses true astronomical positions)</li>
        <li>Look for your <strong>Moon sign</strong> and <strong>Moon Nakshatra</strong> in the results</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Note: Your sidereal Moon sign may differ from your Western Moon sign by approximately one sign due to the precession of equinoxes.</em></p>
